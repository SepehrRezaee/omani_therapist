# 🇴🇲 Omani Voice Therapist

**Privacy-First, AI-Powered, Voice-Only Mental Health Chatbot (Omani Arabic)**

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

Omani Voice Therapist is a privacy-focused, AI-powered web application designed to provide empathetic, culturally relevant mental health support in Omani Arabic—**using only voice**.  
The system enables users to speak naturally via their browser, receive real-time AI-powered therapeutic replies, and never requires text or file uploads.

- **Voice In, Voice Out**: Speak your message, listen to the bot’s reply.
- **Omani Arabic**: Culturally tuned prompts and responses.
- **Anonymous & Private**: All data is stored locally unless otherwise configured.
- **NOT a replacement for professional medical advice or emergency services.**

## 🧑‍💻 Features

- 🎤 **Microphone Input**: Record directly in-browser (Streamlit or Gradio)
- 🗣️ **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Converts voice to text using Gemini API
- 💬 **Empathetic LLM Response**: Replies are generated by Google Gemini LLM, tailored for Omani dialect and empathy
- 😌 **Emotion & Crisis Detection**: Analyzes speech for emotional state and flags possible crises
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Bot replies are sent back as high-quality audio
- 🗃️ **Session Logging**: Secure, local-only logging of all conversations and metadata
- 🛡️ **Consent Gate**: User must accept privacy policy and consent for session logging
- 🏗️ **Containerized**: Fully dockerized for easy deployment
